# Flash Card App
 A live version of this app can be found at https://tony-shifflett.github.io/flashcard-app/

## Tools Used
This app was built in VS Code with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All code was generated by Copilot with minor finessing and error correction by hand. 

## Reflections

This is the second version of the project. The first encountered issues resulting from asking too much of Copilot, leading to the generation of large volumes of erroneous code. For example, my initial prompt provided a detailed description of the MVP, which Copilot then wrote entirely in index.html. Although I was able to segregate the HTML, CSS, and Javasript into the appropriate files, I decided to try again entirely from scratch. 

On the second attempt, found in this code base, I went for smaller, incremental prompts, and found that I was much happier with the results. 

On going issues with Copilot include timeout errors and some difficulties with relying on it for version control. There is also the natural problem of building the backgroud knowledge necessary to efficiently implement the tool. For example, I'm developing my skills around accessible development, so using the right vocabulary within prompts and knowing what to check for is a challenge within the project. 

Moving forward, I intend to develop this app further by experiementing with more complex features and with using AI tools to assist with prompt generation as well.
